Below is a guest post provided by our friends at Dynamic Search. It is a pa=
rt of our ongoing series bringing you valuable content from around the net,=
 with interesting lessons and insights about the business of building and m=
arketing your business through mobile apps.

The hardest part of developing a new app is not the development or design i=
tself, but the marketing of the app after it has been created. It is not en=
ough to simply publish the app and let it be, no one will know about your a=
pp so no one will buy it. It is common for app designers to have a hard tim=
e with marketing; especially with their first app.Thankfully there are some=
 easy tips to get you started with successfully marketing your app. The fol=
lowing is some of the most important and useful tips.

Social Networks

Use social network sites to your advantage. Not only can you promote your a=
pp on your personal accounts, you can also set up pages just for your app. =
That way people can find the page, click to like it and get all the new inf=
ormation as you post it. Make full use of this strategy, set up accounts on=
 Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and any other site you deem approp=
riate. With social networks, your app will get shared by far more people th=
an it will in the app store that you use. You can also target potential use=
rs by searching for them and then posting a link to the app page on their w=
all or direct message them. Look for people who will be interested in your =
specific app, if it is an information app look for people who will need tha=
t specific information, if it is a game look for people that have interests=
 similar to your game.

ASO and SEO

App Store Optimization (ASO) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) are very =
important in the marketing of any mobile app. ASO is the process of improvi=
ng the ranking of your app in app store searches with excellent titles, wel=
l-researched keywords, and great descriptions. SEO is the process of improv=
ing the ranking of any website or page in search engine results with well-p=
laced keywords. With these two things combined, your app is sure to get ple=
nty of hits and downloads. The importance of using ASO and SEO comes in bec=
ause no one will buy what they cannot find and without great rankings, no o=
ne will be able to find your app.

Blogs

Seek the aid of well-known bloggers to get the word out about your new app.=
 Review sites are a good place to start if you can get a few review sites t=
o post a good review of your app it will get more attention. Don=E2=80=99t =
stop there, contact bloggers that are known to write about the type of app =
you created, whether it is a game, information app, or any other niche, the=
re are bloggers out there that specialize in it. Find them and ask them to =
check out your app and if they like it, blog about it. Ask friends or relat=
ives with blogs to do a blog about your app. Once it is out there, you will=
 find that it will gain backlinks time and again as people read about it an=
d try it out.

Agencies

If you do not feel comfortable marketing your app entirely on your own, the=
re is always the option of hiring an agency. The problem most app designers=
 have with hiring an agency is the cost, which can cut drastically into pro=
fit margarine. For some hiring, an agency is ideal because it takes the wor=
ry off of them so that they can better concentrate on designing new feature=
s and levels. It is a complete preference as to hiring an agency; there is =
no right or wrong choice. For some it is a good fit, for others not so much=
.
